    "Sometimes when programming it is normal to require to repeat a certain procedure several times. For example, let's assume that we need to print on the screen all the numbers between 1 and 10. One approach would be to execute `print(1)`, `print(2)`, `print(3)`, and so on. However, in certain cases the number of executions of a piece of code could be very large and it would not be wise to be typing it hundreads of times. To achieve this, we will introduce loops: the repetition of a procedure. We will examine `for loops` and `while loops`."
