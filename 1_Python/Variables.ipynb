    "A Python variable is simply a memory allocation in the computer in which there is a storage of a type of data and a specific name. Variables are important because we can tag a certain object with a name to be used later on in a procedure, such an objects can be texts, numbers or any other data type that we will be studying later on. Variables are assigned in Python with the sign `=`, here is an example:"

Another function I will introduce in this session is the `type()` function that gives us the variable type, as shown next:"
